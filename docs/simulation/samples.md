# Samples

!!! warning "Dimuon boost and sample composition"

    Samples generated with `dimuonboost > 1` are **not** representative of the
    relative fluxes of the different particle species. In particular the
    neutrino flux is heavily diluted: at `dimuonboost = 100` neutrinos make up
    only a few percent of the particles in the file (~28k out of ~660k),
    against roughly half at `dimuonboost = 1` (~23k out of ~45k).

    Perhaps less obviously, the *unboosted* samples also contain a substantial dimuon
    component. Extrapolating linearly from the two boost settings gives
    **~14% of all particles and ~28% of the non-neutrino particles** in the `dimuonboost = 1` case. 
    Anyone using these samples for absolute rates should apply the appropriate event
    weights rather than assuming the unboosted sample is unbiased.
